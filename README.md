A collection of examples about reinforcement learning for education purpose.

These examples are self-contained in the sense that:
- They are ready to run without installing many dependent packages.
- The source code is self-explained. Thus, no additional document to explain the source code.

We welcome your contribute, especially on improving the readibility of the source code as well as simplifying the source code as much as possible.
Please feel free to create a PR or send an email to tungld@gmail.com.
