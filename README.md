A collection of examples about reinforcement learning for education purpose.

These examples are self-contained in the sense that:
- They are ready to run without installing many dependent packages.
- Their code is self-explained. Thus, no additional document to explain the code.

We welcome your contribute, especially on improving the readibility of the code as well as simplifying the code as much as possible.
